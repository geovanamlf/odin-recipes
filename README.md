# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project’s curriculum, focused on building a simple recipe website. It demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML structure and CSS styling. By the end of this project, I’ll have practiced creating multiple web pages, linking them, adding images, and applying CSS for layout and design.
